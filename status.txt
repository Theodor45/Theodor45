I want to get a job in London either as a backend developer, fullstack or cybersecurity specialist.
For that, i am starting out with a easy language like python, learning about syntax, OOP, more libraries like
pandas, smtp, tkinter, turtle, etc.

I'm planning to learn this:
  - Rest API's;
  - CSS&Html;
  - SQL&Databases;
  - AWS or google cloud;
  - Networking and cybersecurity;
  - Git&Docker;
 
 And after all of these, i plan on trying javascript and React JS to see if i would like to become a full-stack dev.
